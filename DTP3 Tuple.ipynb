    "## Tuple\n",
    "In Python, a tuple is a collection data type used to store an ordered sequence of elements. Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, which means once created, their elements cannot be changed or modified. Tuples are defined by enclosing the elements in parentheses () and separating them by commas."

    "Tuples in Python are ordered collections, ensuring that the sequence in which elements are added remains intact. They possess the capability to hold elements of various data types, spanning integers, floats, strings, and even nested tuples. Accessing elements within a tuple is akin to lists, relying on indexing. A notable characteristic of tuples is their immutability, signifying that once formed, their elements cannot be altered, appended, or deleted. Consequently, tuples find frequent application in depicting fixed assortments of items, exemplified by use cases like representing coordinates, database records, or configuration settings."
